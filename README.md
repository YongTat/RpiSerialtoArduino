# RpiSerialtoArduino
 
Using Rpi with dragino hat for lora and pyLoRa (https://pypi.org/project/pyLoRa/) to send and recieve data to arduinos with Dragino hats

Currently the asynctexst.py will be the listener for the lora packets and LoRaTXSensorLowPower.ino is the arduino code for the sending of information.
